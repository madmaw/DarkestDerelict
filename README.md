Ah, the life of a space marine. You got yer-self some sweet power armour, a nice little sidearm, and all the cans of ground beef you could ever want. Only one thing that ruins it. And that's the BUGS!

Damn things. Appear from nowhere. Eat yer crew. Lay eggs in their brains. The whole lot. Disgusting! Hopefully this will just be a routine mission. I'm sure this derelict space ship will be as empty as my last can of space beef...

Controls

* Arrow keys or swipe to move
* Drag and drop items in to your inventory equip/eat them, or out to drop/use them, as appropriate
* Drag a friendly marine to an unused slot to get them to join your team
* Tap a marine or an enemy to preview their attack when in combat
* Tap again to use that attack

Combat Manual

Combat is initiated by walking adjacent to an enemy. You will need to face the enemy in order to attack it. If you manage to walk behind an enemy, then you do not need to wait for them to face you before attacking. The enemy certainly will not extend you that courtesy.

The hallways of the spaceship are cramped, so only one person can attack at a time. Marines are very independent and refuse to be micromanaged. Once ordered to attack, they determine the best method to use based on how much energy (▲) they have, and their weapon. You can preview what each person in your party (or the enemy's party) will do by clicking on them once during combat and reviewing your Head-Up Display (HUD).

Marines have two main resources

■ health

If a marine runs out of health they immediately die. This should be avoided where possible. Marines may recover health by eating cans of ground space beef. The correlation between the presence of giant spiders and an overabundance of space beef is entirely coincidental.

▲ energy

Your power armour is a wonderful piece of technology and is your first, last, and only, line of defence in combat. Power armour requires time to charge after moving, so your weapons will be temporary offline while walking, but will power up quickly provided you remain stationary. Maximizing your energy supply, while minimizing the enemy's, is the key to being victorious in combat.

Space Tips

* Attacks from the back row tend to do less damage, but hit more targets, than attacks from the front row. Try to move dangerous enemies to the back row.
* Do not underestimate the utility of an unarmed space marine. 
* Poison is easily dealt with outside of combat. If you accumulate too much poison, consider running away. Alternately, if you have some, space beef cures poisoning.
* Know your squad. Marines from different factions (colors) have slightly different behaviours or resources.
* The torch will drive monsters back in close quarter combat.
* Consider setting up an optimal formation before entering combat.

Good luck marine!
